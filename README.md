ARLookbook
==========
AY-AR (COMPLETE-ish)
Apart from some debugging and some extra features we still have to add, weâ€™re all done with our final project, AY-AR! The idea starting out was to have a Lookbook that would be in a store and allow you either to mix-and-match, view 3d models of items of clothing, view 2D images of clothing items along side a model wearing those items and try the clothes on. We used Augmented Reality.
